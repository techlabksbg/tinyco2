# PCB
The PCB has been designed using EasyEDA. The current state of the project there howewer does not
correspond to the gerber files. The layout and pin-connections to the AtTiny have been change.

# Suggestions
Change and/or add alternative Power-Connections. Those USB-Plugs are hard to come by (contact me, I have 95 more lying around).

## Purchase links:
I'm not affiliated with those suppliers. I ordered here. Worked for me, might not work for you.
  - CO2-Sensor: MH-Z19B. Prefer one with already soldered headers: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000212024923.html
  - ATTiny85: Not available anymore from where I ordered. 
  - USB-Connector: Good luck, or better get a new one/alternative power plug.
  - TM1637 7Segment display: Not available anymore from where I ordered.
  - Powersupply: 5V, 0.5A is sufficient (any old cell phone charger will do).
  - Chipsocket (optional)
  - Pin-Headers (any will do)
  - 4 Dupont-Cables to connect the display
  - Optional JST sockets and matching cables, like: JST XH2.54 XH 2.54mm Wire Cable Connector
